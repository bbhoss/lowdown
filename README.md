# Lowdown

Lowdown is a server library for building HL7 network servers with the MLLP protocol.

## TODO

Adopt a similar architecuture to Plug for performing transformations and actions
Add a routing system so different messages can be routed to different "pipelines"
Remove the HL7 generation/parsing to its own package, as it really doesn't belong here
Document using Lowdown from another application
